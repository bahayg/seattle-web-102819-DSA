 # Given an array of single socks of different colors, write a method that matches up your socks in pairs. 

# Socks Array = [red, green, blue, red, green, green, blue, green, blue, red]

# Return a hash giving us how many pairs we have of each color.

# If the last two socks don't match, save them as a mismatched pair in the hash.
